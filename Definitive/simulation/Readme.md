# Simulation

This folder contains the code used to generate the network's synthetic data, as extensively explained in `Sec. 5.2`. Whenever possible, the parameters are explained and described making reference to the Eq. number in the Master's thesis document.

- `CIR.py` contains the code needed to simulate multiple CIR processes. Please note that the code is not CUDA-compatible as the improvements were neglectible.
