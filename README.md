# Generative-models-for-financial-networks

Part of my MSc thesis @ETH mathn dept.

The repo is organized in folders according to the specific task that is there tackled. The tasks are ordered by increasing difficulty and the models used could vary according the the implementations that I was able of finding.

- UU-graph generation: *unweighted* and *undirected* graph generation
- U-graph generation: *unweighted* graph generation
- graph generation: generation of weighted and directed graph
- C-graph generation: conditioned generation of graphs
- D-graph generation: generation of dynamic graphs
- DC-graph generation: conditioned generation of dynamic graphs
