# Generative-models-for-financial-networks

Part of my MSc thesis @ETH mathn dept.

The repo is organized in folders according to the specific task that is there tackled. The tasks are ordered by increasing difficulty and the models used could vary according the the implementations that I was able of finding.

- **UU-graph_generation**: *unweighted* and *undirected* graph generation
- **U-graph_generation**: *unweighted* graph generation
- **D-graph_link_prediction** *dynamic* graph link prediction
