Here we explore the easiest task within graph generation: the generation of unweighted and undirected graphs, which are represented as binary and symmetric adjacency matrices.
The models that are taken into account are the `NetGAN` model and the `CELL` model, both tested on datasets of increasing size:

- `SmallGraph`: small UU-graph consisting of 332 nodes.
- `Cora-ML`: citation network with 2810 nodes
- `CiteSeer`: citation network with 4230 nodes and multiple connected components.
